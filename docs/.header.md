# terraform-azurerm-resource-group

An **Azure Resource Group** is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. It provides a logical grouping that allows you to manage and organize resources such as virtual machines, storage accounts, and virtual networks as a single entity. Resource groups help simplify management, enable role-based access control (RBAC) at the group level, and provide visibility for billing and monitoring.
